## Notification triggers

Each instance can be configured independently to notify on any combination of:

- New ticket created
- New message from the requester on an existing ticket
- Staff reply posted on a ticket
- Ticket status changed (reopened, etc.)
- Ticket closed

Since osTicket has no dedicated signal for ticket status changes, this is
detected by listening to the ORM's `model.updated` signal on the `Ticket`
model and inspecting the dirty `status_id` field.

## Message templates

The message posted for each event type is fully customizable per instance.
The following placeholders are available in any template:

`{mention}` `{id}` `{number}` `{subject}` `{name}` `{email}` `{department}`
`{priority}` `{status}` `{old_status}` `{agent}` `{message}`

`{mention}` (e.g. `@here`, `@everyone`, or a role mention) is only applied to
the new-ticket message by default, but can be added manually to any other
template as well.
